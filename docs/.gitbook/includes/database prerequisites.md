OpsHub Integration Manager can be deployed with an embedded database; however, for production deployment or anything other than functional testing, our experts highly recommend using an external database. OpsHub Integration Manager supports the following database.

## 1. MySQL Server

- **Supported versions:** From 5.7.18 or above  
- **Wait time for connection pool** should be set to 8 hours.

- For seamless running of OpsHub Integration Manager, the permissions mentioned for installation and upgrade only can be revoked.

- The default installation of OpsHub Integration Manager with Oracle:
  - Two users are created by OpsHub Integration Manager: `opshub` and `reportsdb`. 
  - The user through which the database is connected will perform the following:
    - Create these users. Hence, `CREATE USER` permission is required at the installation time.
    - Grant certain permissions to these users (`opshub` and `reportsdb`) to connect with their database and create the required data in their database. Hence, `WITH ADMIN OPTION` is required.
    - Perform certain operations on the resources of these two users. Hence, it requires `ANY*` permissions.

- In the advanced installation, if OpsHub Integration Manager is going to be installed with the option of the [manual creation of the database](installation.md#manual-creation-of-the-databases), then:
  - One of the users (`opshub` or `reportsdb`) can be used to connect with the Oracle database and perform all the operations.
  - In this case, `CREATE USER` privilege can be omitted, and only `SELECT ANY TABLE` privilege would require `WITH ADMIN OPTION` during installation.

- It is recommended to create a database manually for a high-security environment. The credentials are used as input to create two new users during the installation, so `CREATE USER` permission is required.  
  If any permission regarding creating a user is missing, then OpsHub Integration Manager will print the password through SQL query.  
  'Create schema' approach was considered, but as Oracle doesn't allow creating schemas alone, we have to go with the 'Create User' approach.

- If installation is to be done in the **cdb$root container of CDB instance**, then the connection user should have the commonly granted `CREATE USER` permission.  
  To achieve this, the `container=ALL` clause needs to be used while granting the permission.  
  The sample query for creating the user:
  
   `CREATE USER c##username IDENTIFIED BY password container=ALL;`

- After the user is created, the permission should be verified with the following query:  
  `SELECT * FROM USER_SYS_PRIVS;`

- Find the below screenshot which shows correct permission for CREATE USER privilege:

## 4. PostgreSQL Server

- **Supported versions:** From 15 or above  
- The user must have **CREATEDB** permission for creating database.

In the advanced installation, if **OpsHub Integration Manager** is installed with the option of the [manual creation of the database](installation-steps.md#manual-creation-of-the-databases), then:

- The user must have permission for **CREATE ON SCHEMA** for both the schemas (`opshub` and `reportsdb`) for creating tables, index, references, and views.
- The manually created database and schema should only contain **lowercase alphanumeric characters**, with `$`, `_`, and **no spaces**.

![Note](../assets/Note.jpg)  
If default connection timeout parameter is changed for any database server, then it must be confirmed that sufficient connection timeout has been set.  
For example, for MySQL the default server-side connection timeout is 8 hours.  
If it is changed and set to, say, 5 minutes, then the default server-side connection timeout must be updated accordingly.

**OpsHub Integration Manager** maintains connection pools that keep connections alive for 8 hours.  
Based on the need, this parameter can be tuned at both the application and database-server levels.  
**Generally, the recommended timeout is between 6–8 hours.**
