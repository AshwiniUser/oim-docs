![Offline Registration Warning](../assets/Freemium_Offline_Registration_Warning.PNG)

When you are using Offline Registration option, user can either send the user detials in encrypted format or in decrypted manner. To send the data in encrypted manner, refer to [Get Verification Code using Encrypted User Details](#get-verification-code-using-encrypted-details). If the user wants to know the exact details they are sending to OpsHub Integration Manager, they can use the decrypted registered details. Refer to [Get Verification Code using Decrypted User Details](#get-verification-code-using-decrypted-user-details).

## Get Verification Code using Encrypted Details

Send `RegistrationDetails.zip` on CommunityManagers@opshub.com. Verification Code will be then shared with you on your registered business email address.  
Once you get the verification code, enter the code in the screen shown below and continue with the installation/upgrade.

![Verify Email Offline](../assets/Freemium_Verify_Email_Offline_Registration_1.PNG)

## Get Verification Code using Decrypted User Details

* A zip file containing the decryption utility is copied to the OpsHub Integration Manager installation folder. Follow the below steps to get the decrypted user data for the verification code generation:
  * Unzip the zip `DecryptionUtility.zip` and extract DecryptionUtility from it. [In the extracted folder, the `DecryptionUtility.jar` will be available].
  * In the extracted folder, the `details.properties` is available. Mention the below details in that file:
    * Specify the `zipFilePath` where `RegistrationDetails.zip` is present (Do not change the name of the `RegistrationDetials.zip`)
    * Specify the `destDirectory`, the directory where you want to store the Decrypted UserDetails output file.

> ðŸ“Œ Use forward slash ("/") in the paths specified in the `details.properties` file.

* Open the Command Prompt at the location where `DecryptionUtility.jar` is placed.
  * **For Windows OS:**
    * Type the command: `start <path to jre>\bin\javaw -jar DecryptionUtility.jar`  
      For example:  
      `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Temp\CBA6.tmp\jre\bin\javaw -jar DecryptionUtility.jar`  
    * To reach to `<path to jre>`, follow the below steps:
      * Open Run dialog box, write `%temp%` and hit Enter.
      * Go to the latest created Temp folder. This folder will contain `jre` folder. Use this path as `<path to jre>` in the above mentioned command.
  * **For Linux OS:**
    * Type the command: `<path to jre>/bin/java -DOPSHUB_TEMP_DATA=$OPSHUB_TEMP_DATA -jar DecryptionUtility.jar`  
      For example:  
      `/home/administrator/Downloads/OIMV7_130_Linux_OpsHub/jre/bin/java -DOPSHUB_TEMP_DATA=$OPSHUB_TEMP_DATA -jar DecryptionUtility.jar`
    * To reach to `<path to jre>`, follow the below steps:
      * Go to OpsHub Integration Manager installation folder. This folder will contain a jre zip. Unzip the jre and use this as `<path to jre>` in the above mentioned command.

* The decrypted UserDetails will be stored in file named `DecryptedRegistrationDetails.txt`.

> ðŸ“Œ The output file will contain the decrypted userdetails and encrypted Key and Salt value [due to security purpose]. Here, mail `DecryptedRegistrationDetails.txt` file on CommunityManagers@opshub.com. The verification code will be then shared with you on your registered business email address.  

Once you get the verification code, enter the code in the screen shown below and continue with the installation/upgrade.
